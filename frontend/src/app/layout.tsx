// For example, if you want to cache for 60 seconds, use `revalidate = 60`

// Note: The `dynamic` and `revalidate` exports are specific to Next.js 13+ with the App Router.
// They control how often the layout is re-rendered and whether it should be cached.

// If you are using Next.js 12 or earlier, you can remove these exports.
// The layout will still work, but it won't have the dynamic re-rendering behavior.

// Ensure you have the necessary packages installed:
// npm install next-themes next@latest @next/font framer-motion lucide-react
// Adjust the package versions based on your Next.js version.
